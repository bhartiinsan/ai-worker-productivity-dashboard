## ✨ Pro Tips

1. **Order Topics by Importance**: GitHub displays first few prominently; put primary focus first
2. **Consistency**: Use established topics where possible (GitHub suggests popular ones)
3. **Update Periodically**: As features grow, add relevant topics (e.g., `kafka`, `grafana`, if integrated)
4. **Avoid Overstuffing**: Limit to 5–8 topics; beyond that, discoverability becomes noise
5. **Check Competitors**: Look at similar projects' topics for inspiration

**Example Competitor Topics**:
- `grafana` → factory-automation, real-time-dashboard, iot-analytics
- `promethus` → monitoring, metrics, real-time-dashboard
- `Apache Superset` → analytics, dashboard, data-visualization
